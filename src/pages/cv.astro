      With nearly 10 years of experience in the entertainment and corporate technology industries, I specialize in supporting and delivering creative projects and technical solutions for live events, broadcast, and film productions. Currently, as a Technical Support Specialist at Disguise, I have contributed to high-profile projects like Eurovision, Morgan Wallen, and Taylor Swift. My work with leading clients such as CT, Solotech, and PRG, as well as broadcast clients like Bloomberg and Whitelight, demonstrates my ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions under pressure.
